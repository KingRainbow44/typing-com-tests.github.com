This sentence your typing is also hard. Going along with typing easy sentences is one of the ways to counter this issue. Another way is to think ahead while typing. Thinking about what to type ahead is better for the brain and allows you to type any kind of sentence with any kind of word. Although you would think this is the easyest test in the world, it really makes you think about if you are really a god at typing.","intro":"","new_key":null,"screen_type":"standard","dictation_type":"words","display_order":0},{"lesson_screen_id":115856,"lesson_id":385,"title":"Mountain Biking","content":"The sport of mountain biking is one of the best active sports you can partake in for a number of fitness reasons. Depending on what style of mountain biking you enjoy, it can also be a great deal of fun while keeping you fit at the same time. People are usually unaware of how many muscles they use when riding a mountain bike and how quickly they burn calories; it can be an extremely good workout for the body. If you plan on riding cross-country along different types of trails, riding a bike can be quite a task. If you're riding over long distances up and down hills it can be very tiring for the legs and lower back. So if you are just starting to ride bikes for the first time, please don't just jump on the bike and go for a 20-mile ride as it may do you more harm than good. One recommendation is to begin by going on short rides of only a couple of miles, which take no time at all, in order to get your fitness training up to a higher level before embarking on longer rides. All the major athletes in the sport will tell you that training is important and you should take part in mountain bike fitness training whenever an opportunity arises. One of the greatest benefits of riding a mountain bike on a regular basis is that bike riding engages some of the largest muscles in the body which, in turn, burns off fat quickly. This will, of course, help you to lose weight and the more you ride your bike, the more weight you will lose. When you ride your bike on flat ground at a slower speed, you will still burn a great number of calories due to the fact that you will be able to continue pedaling for longer periods. This is also perfect for people who don't have the stamina for highly-intensive rides at different speeds and climbs.","intro":"","new_key":null,"screen_type":"standard","dictation_type":"words","display_order":1}];
